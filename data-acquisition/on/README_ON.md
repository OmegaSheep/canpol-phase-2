### ONTARIO READ ME

Ontario has consistent ethics disclosures.

Rather than release a PDF for each MPP, Ontario has a searchable online
portal where you can find the data for each MPP.

This unfortunately means to get the data, we need the automation to type in every MPP's name,
open their page, and scrape the HTML into a usable format.

Aside from a few mismatched names and one or two pages with differing HTML, this is fairly consistent.

It's just quite slow, and unpleasant to write code for.

Overall Data Score: Good

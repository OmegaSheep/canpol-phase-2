### YUKON READ ME

Yukon has ethics disclosures.

They are released in PDF form.

We have not tried to process them yet as we only recently discovered that the Yukon has this data at all,
it is not typical for territorial governments.

Cursory investigation suggests the data quality and readability should be quite good. Fingers crossed.

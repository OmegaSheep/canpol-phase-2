### Quebec READ ME

Quebec has somewhat consistent ethics disclosures.

They are released in PDF form, and PDF processors can reasonably process them.

Quebec's failing is the data itself - they misspell the names of multiple politicians, and
often do not declare assets that meet the qualifications to be declared.

Our journalist collaborator Isaac Peltz was especially disappointed with the quality of what was declared.

Additionally one MNA uploaded a PDF where the first two pages were flat out missing.

Overall Data Score: Okay

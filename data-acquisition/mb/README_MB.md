### MANITOBA READ ME

Manitoba has consistent ethics disclosures.

They are released in PDF form, and PDF processors struggle significantly to format them effectively.

Any attempt to machine read them produces unpredictable whitespace, newline characters and other artifacts
that at this time we have not found a reliable way to solve.

We attempted to summarize the Manitoba disclosures using an LLM but it did a bad job and people hated
the results. We need to find a reliable PDF processor, or do this manually. 

The MLA website for Manitoba has some name inconsistencies, HTML inconsistencies and other small problems that
our automation has had to adapt to.

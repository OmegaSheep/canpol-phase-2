### NOVA SCOTIA READ ME

Nova Scotia has relatively inconsistent ethics disclosures.

Rather than release a PDF for each MLA, Nova Scotia releases a giant 200+ page PDF containing
everyone's forms, which are handwritten and not machine readable.

Additionally, even within the released data many MLA's do not fill out the form at all,
or provide very little information about what they do declare relative to their peers.

The overall data quality is limited, even ignoring the PDF catastrophe.

Overall Data Score: Horrible

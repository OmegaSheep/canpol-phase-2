    h1 About Us
    p Democracy functions best when people are informed. Our mission is to take publicly available data about elected officials and make it easily accessible for all Canadians.
    p This website was created by Canadian Developers inspired by a data source originally compiled through the investigative work of #[a(href='https://linktr.ee/ixcwylde') Isaac Peltz] and #[a(href='https://linktr.ee/duoduet') Gabrielle Brassard-Lecours] and accessed via Discord.

    h2#disclaimer Disclaimer
    p This site is a work-in-progress and updated regularly. While we strive for accuracy, there may be errors in the data.
    p If you notice any inaccuracies, please contact #[u=t("contactEmail")] or Isaac Peltz.

    h2#methodology Methodology
    p Federal data is sourced from a public registry which is maintained by the #[a(href=t("prciec.href"))=t("prciec.label")]. This registry is updated yearly for current members of parliament when there is a relevant change in their summary statements, public declarations relating to gifts or other advantages, travel, outside activities and certain assets and liabilities, and other declarations as necessary.
    p We regularly update this site as new data is released. Please refer to the relevant public registry for further information.
    p For Provincial data, we use similar public registries which are listed accordingly on the relevant pages.
